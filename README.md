Cisco Virtual Internship Program 2022, Industry Problem Statement: The goal of this industry problem is to create Packet Flow Visualizer to depict the packet flow from student’s laptop/Desktop (Host) to outside  college network.

## This project has two parts :

Create a Network topology - Students can use the tools like traceroute as well as talk to network administrator of the college to know which 
all devices are present in the college network. Based on the inputs, Students can use the Cisco Packet tracer to draw the network topology. 
This topology will depict different Network devices, Network design as well as Network Boundaries as explained in the Network essential 
course from a host to the external network (outside college network).

Investigate Packet flow - In this section, based on the topology created above & with ipv4 Addresses configured on all (layer-3) devices in the 
topology created on Cisco Packet tracer. Students will use any packet Sniffer (Inbuilt sniffer in Cisco packet tracer: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsCSKQAVT2M or Wireshark) collect the packets at each device. By analyzing the packet from various 
devices (nodes), students can stitch the information from packet headers (changes happening in the Ethernet Header and IP Header) to create 
the flow of packet path from their device (Host) to the external network from their campus. For creating flow diagram of the packet flow, 
students can use any flow chart creator application.

## Problem Outcome :
Based on the packet inspection & investigation done on packet headers at each node, Student should be able to demonstrate an 
understanding of–

Different blocks of network design.
Understand the different OSI model layers and be able to articulate the need for layering. Understand the relationship between the layers and 
packet headers and the meta data carried at each layer in the packet header.
Understand the role of different devices in a network. Clearly able to distinguish the role of a router (L3 device) from that of a switch (L2 
device)
